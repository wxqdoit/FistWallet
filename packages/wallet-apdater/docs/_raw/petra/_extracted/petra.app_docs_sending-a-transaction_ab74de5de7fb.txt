[H1] Sending a Transaction
[P] After your web app is connected to Petra, the web app can prompt the user to sign and send transactions to the Aptos blockchain.
[P] Petra API handles the transactions in two ways:
[LI] Sign a transaction and submit it to the Aptos blockchain. Return a pending transaction to the web app.
[LI] Sign a transaction but do not submit the transaction to the Aptos blockchain. Return the signed transaction to the web app for the web app to submit the transaction.
[P] See the below examples for both the options.
[P] For more on Aptos transactions, see the Aptos
SDKs (opens in a new tab) and Transactions guide from
Aptos (opens in a new tab).
[H2] Sign and submit
[CODE] The below code example shows how to use the signAndSubmitTransaction()
[CODE] const wallet = getAptosWallet(); // see "Connecting"
 
// Example Transaction, following an [EntryFunctionPayload](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/ecosystem/typescript/sdk/src/generated/models/EntryFunctionPayload.ts#L8-L21)
const transaction = {
  arguments: [address, '717'],
  function: '0x1::coin::transfer',
  type: 'entry_function_payload',
  type_arguments: ['0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin'],
};
 
try {
  const pendingTransaction = await(
    window as any,
  ).aptos.signAndSubmitTransaction(transaction);
 
  // In most cases a dApp will want to wait for the transaction, in these cases you can use the typescript sdk
  const client = new AptosClient('https://testnet.aptoslabs.com');
  const txn = await client.waitForTransactionWithResult(
    pendingTransaction.hash,
  );
} catch (error) {
  // see "Errors"
}
[H2] Sign only
[P] IMPORTANT: We don't recommend using this because in most cases you don't need it, and it isn't super safe for users. They will receive an extra warning for this.
[CODE] The below code example shows how to use the signTransaction()
[CODE] const wallet = getAptosWallet(); // see "Connecting"
 
// Example Transaction
const transaction = {
  arguments: [address, '717'],
  function: '0x1::coin::transfer',
  type: 'entry_function_payload',
  type_arguments: ['0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin'],
};
 
try {
  const signTransaction = await (window as any).aptos.signTransaction(
    transaction,
  );
} catch (error) {
  // see "Errors"
}
